## Capstone
I'm looking to work on a **mobile app project** to get experience with **Swift or other mobile dev technologies**. I'd love to work on a project that can be applied to the real world today that works to solve a problem we're currently facing. I want experience working with the back-end so I can work towards becoming a fullstack developer and would love to work on the UI designs.
